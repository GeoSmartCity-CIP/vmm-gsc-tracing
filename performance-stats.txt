JPA fetch
330.000 sewerpipes id only = ~5s
330.000 sewerpipes with attributes and geometry = ~15s

Build directed graph
300-500ms, same for any type of content (id or object).

trace (breadthfirst iteration with loop detection)
~7ms
very fast and consistent!

Fetch data with a list of id's (the trace): 0.5s / 1000 objects
Non-linear performance and probably a limit on the length of the id list.

No memory issues
